= Exercise
In this lab, you will create a basic web application using *Genie* framework in Julia. The application will allow us to control the behaviour of a sine wave, given some adjustble parameters. You are required to carry out this lab using the REPL as in @fig:repl.

#exo[Sine Wave Control][We provide the Julia and HTML codes to build and run a web app that allows us to control the amplitude and frequency of a sine wave. *Plotly* is used to plot the corresponding graph. We also added a slider to change the number of samples used to draw the figure. The latter setting permits to grasp the influence of sampling frequency on the look of our chart.]`

#let code=read("../Codes/web-app/app.jl")
#raw(code, lang: "julia")


#let code=read("../Codes/web-app/app.jl.html")
#raw(code, lang: "html")

```zsh
julia --project
```

````julia
julia> using GenieFramework
julia> Genie.loadapp() # Load app
julia> up() # Start server
```

We can now open the browser and navigate to the link #highlight[#link("localhost:8000")[localhost:8000]]. We will get the graphical interface as in @fig:genie-webapp.

#test[You are asked to add two extra sliders that modify the behaviour of the sine wave graph:
	+ _Phase_ ranging between $-pi$ and $pi$, changes by a step of $pi/100$
	+ _Offset_ varies from $-0.5$ to $1$, by a step of $0.1$.]
